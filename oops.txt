1) As soon as obj is created the __init__ method is called automatically.

2) Everything in python is an object (data structure, data type).

3) advantages of oops:
    1. create custom data type
    2. code reusability
    3. debugging
    4. easy to collab

4) Function vs Method:

len(), sorted(): Function

to call a method, first create an obj and then obj_name.method_name()

5) You can create attribute outside class as well

obj=oops()

obj.email='gVWpW@example.com'

print(obj.email)

6)self refers to the current instance of the class
